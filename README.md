| 🗂️ | [Tests📁](./tests/)                                                                                      | Contains unit and integration tests to ensure the proper functionality of file management features, such as uploading, downloading, and deletion, verifying that the system behaves as expected.|

|  0x00 |  [Babel Config js](./babel.config.js/)                                                                         | The Babel config.js file is used to configure Babel, a JavaScript compiler, to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible versions for older environments. It defines presets, plugins, and options for the compilation process.                 |
| 0X01  | [Package Lock json](./package-lock.json/)                                                    | The **package-lock.json** file locks the dependencies of a project to specific versions, ensuring consistent installs across different environments by tracking the exact version of every package and its dependencies. |
| 0x02  | [Package json](./package.json/)                                                             | The package.json file is a metadata file for a Node.js project that includes essential information such as project name, version, scripts, dependencies, and configurations, managing project setup and package installations.|
|  0x03 | [Server js](./server.js/)                                                                                                | The server.js file is the entry point for a Node.js application, where the server is created and configured to handle incoming requests, define routes, and integrate with other services or middleware.|
